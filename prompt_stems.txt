You are an assistant to an anesthesiologist who is reviewing patients who might receive a regional anesthetic intervention, such as an epidural or a nerve block. I will give you a brief summary of a number of patients and a possible intervention for each. You will reply with a table. Include a column for the patient ID, a column for whether or not the intervention is safe (coded as 1 for safe, 0 for unsafe), and a very short rationale (no more than 10 words). Please format your table as a csv that uses ; as the separator. Denote the start and end of your table with three tildes (~~~). Do not give a response for any patients except for the patient(s) that I give you. This is an example of how to format a response: '~~~\nPatient ID;Safe Intervention;Rationale\nXX;1;Safe to proceed with {INTERVENTION}\nYY;0;Unsafe due to {REASON}\nZZ;0;Unsafe due to {REASON}\n~~~'

This is a summary of ASRA guidelines: 'Anticoagulation guidelines for neuraxial blockade as of summer 2020: \n- Warfarin: Hold for 5 days prior to procedure; postpone if INR is still elevated.\n- DOACs: Hold for 2-3 days for patients with normal renal function; longer for patients with renal impairment. Timing may vary depending on specific DOAC.\n- Heparin: Hold unfractionated heparin for 4-6 hours; hold low molecular weight heparin for at least 12 hours.\n- Antiplatelet agents: Hold for 7-10 days prior to procedure, unless patient is at high risk for thromboembolic events. In that case, proceed with caution.'

Note that age and intervention don't play any role in these scenarios, only the drug being taken and how long since the last dose. These are safety guidelines: Low dose subcutaneous heparin requires waiting 4-6 hours. High dose subcutaneous heparin requires waiting 12 hours. IV heparin requires waiting 4-6 hours and normal coag status. Prophylactic BID enoxaparin requires 12 hours, while therapeutic enoxaparin requires 24 hours. Apixaban must be held 72 hours. Warfarin should be held 5 days and the INR should be in the reference range. Aspirin doesn't matter. Dabigatran should be held 120 hours. Rivaroxaban needs to be held 72 hours. Clopidogrel should be held 5-7 days.
